<p>Private Internet Access provides a popular Virtual Private Network (VPN) service where I held 
different positions that let me utilise my Ruby, JavaScript, C and shell script knowledge.</p>

<p>I was on the web team, where I helped maintain a Ruby on Rails application that received a high volume of traffic. I helped maintain and write code that optimised the site for search engines, that optimised the site for performance using HTTP level compression and other techniques, processed payments using a multitude of payment processors, and dealt with translating the website to over 16 different languages.</p>

<p>I was on the desktop team where I helped maintain an application built with C, Ruby, and node-webkit. The application runs on Windows, Linux, and macOS. I gained a lot of experience 
with build tooling, and became familiar with Vagrant and other VM software. The application has 
in excess of 100,000 users.</p>

<p>I was on the browser extension team, where I was the primary author of a browser extension that let users connect to a wide range of HTTPS proxy servers in different regions of the world. The extension also optimised a users browser to put privacy first through configurable settings. The extension is <a href="https://github.com/pia-foss/extension-chrome">open source</a> and still in use today, with over 100,000 users. The extension uses the popular React framework and other modern JavaScript libraries.</p>

<p>I was employed as a remote employee while at Private Internet Access.</p>

<p>Storyful provides a service where it uses modern techniques such as machine learning to 
find breaking news on social media platforms.</p>

<p>At storyful, I worked on a small team where I was employed primarily as a backend engineer.
I worked closely with team mates and journalists to help build and maintain a Ruby on Rails application that found media of interest for journalists working at Storyful and other media companies.</p>

<p>I also helped author and maintain a Ruby On Rails application that provided health status updates for services such as MySQL and memcached that were used by other Storyful applications.</p>

<p>I was able to share my Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript knowledge while working at Storyful, and 
worked directly from Storyfulâ€™s office in Dublin, Ireland.</p>

<h3 id="general-assembly-december-2011---june-2014"><a href="https://www.generalassemb.ly">General Assembly</a> (December 2011 - June 2014)</h3>

<p>General Assembly is an education company that provides courses and workshops on their campuses around the world, and online.</p>

<p>At General Assembly, I was employed as a software engineer that helped maintain a
Ruby On Rails application that processed payments for available courses and workshops, as well as 
maintaining parts of the application that scheduled courses and workshops.</p>

<p>I authored and maintained a component of the application that received feedback from students 
in the form of surveys and questionaires.</p>

<p>I helped author and maintain a separate application that allowed courses and workshops to be streamed through video, which were offered through free and paid subscription plans.</p>

<p>I was able to share my Ruby, Rails, and JavaScript knowledge while working at General Assembly, 
and had the opportunity to become familiar with both the Stripe and Braintree payment processors.</p>

<p>I was employed as a remote employee while at General Assembly.</p>

<p>Fashism was a social media company that let users vote on clothing items or other fashion accessories. Feedback and advice could also be given in the form of comments.</p>

<p>At Fashism, I was employed as a Ruby On Rails engineer. I helped oversee the upgrade from Ruby 1.8 to Ruby 1.9, and from Rails 2.x to Rails 3.x. I helped to maintain the application, where
I worked on a small team of 3 to fix bugs and implement new features.</p>

<p>I was able to share my Ruby and Rails knowledge while I worked at Fashism, and had the 
opportunity to become familiar with the upgrade process of Ruby and Rails.</p>

<p>I was employed as a remote employee while at Fashism.</p>
